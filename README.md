## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process
The process I took was adding in all of the components present in the sample with no css. Then, using bootstrap and css to fix the formatting, get the colours right, and generally making it as similar as possible to the example.

### Built with

Next
Bootstrap


### What I learned

Although I had known about google fonts already, one thing I learned is that you can import the google fonts directly into a css file versus linking it in the head element.

```
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@100;300;400;600&display=swap');
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I would like to focus on user authentication with react and next. I would like to be able to integrate google log in to my sites.
